GitHub Flavored Markdown also trims out most HTML from Markdown documents. This will strip out any potentially unsafe content such as JavaScript scripts that could inject malicious code to the page. Limited HTML constructs such as <table> tags and some style attributes such as align="center" are allowed.
All .md files on GitHub can be viewed as their GitHub Flavored Markdown output by visiting the file in GitHub’s file viewer, such as the Codecademy Docs README.md. You can also see the raw input file with the Raw link on that page:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codecademy/docs/main/README.md. 

After writing a few README.md and other .md files, you’ll get the hang of Markdown! It’s extremely powerful and lets you clearly present your coding work.
